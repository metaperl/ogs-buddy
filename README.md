# OGS Buddy

OGS Buddy is a tool to help make flashcards of OGS positions.

1. Review a game using the OGS AI facility
1. When you see a move where the AI did something much better than your choice, click "Make Flashcard" and a flashcard is made for you in the [Anki flashcard program](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
1. Review your flashcards regularly to improve your ability to do better in those same positions.
